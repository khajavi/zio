`Task[A]` is a type alias for `ZIO[Any, Throwable, A]`, which represents an effect that has no requirements, and may fail with a `Throwable` value, or succeed with an `A`.

Let's see how the `Task` type alias is defined:

```scala mdoc:invisible
import zio.ZIO
```

```scala mdoc:silent
type Task[+A] = ZIO[Any, Throwable, A]
```

So the `Task` just equal to `ZIO` which doesn't require any dependency. Its error channel is `Throwable`, so it may fail with `Throwable` and may succeed with an `A` value.

> In Scala, the _type alias_ is a way to give a name to another type, to avoid having to repeat the original type again and again. It doesn't affect the type-checking process. It just helps us to have an expressive API design.

Some time, we know that our effect may fail, but we don't care the type of that exception, this is where we can use `Task`. The type signature of this type-alias is similar to the `Future[T]` and Cats `IO`.

If we want to be less precise and want to eliminate the need to think about requirements and error types, we can use `Task`. This type-alias is a good start point for anyone who wants to refactor the current code base which is written in Cats `IO` or Monix `Task`.
