## ZIO Environment
The `ZIO[-R, +E, +A]` data type describes an effect that requires an input type of `R`, as an environment, may fail with an error of type `E` or succeed and produces a value of type `A`.

The input type is also known as _environment type_. This type-parameter indicates that to run an effect we need one or some services as an environment of that effect.

For example, when we have `ZIO[Console, Nothing, Unit]`, this shows that to run this effect we need to provide an implementation of the `Console` service:

```scala mdoc:silent
import zio.ZIO
import zio.console._
val effect: ZIO[Console, Nothing, Unit] = putStrLn("Hello, World!")
```

So finally when we provide a live version of `Console` service to our `effect`, it will be converted to an effect that doesn't require any environmental service:

```scala mdoc:silent
val mainApp: ZIO[Any, Nothing, Unit] = effect.provideLayer(Console.live)
```

Finally, to run our application we can put our `mainApp` inside the `run` method:

```scala mdoc:silent:nest
import zio.{ExitCode, ZEnv, ZIO}
import zio.console._

object MainApp extends zio.App {
  val effect: ZIO[Console, Nothing, Unit] = putStrLn("Hello, World!")
  val mainApp: ZIO[Any, Nothing, Unit] = effect.provideLayer(Console.live)

  override def run(args: List[String]): ZIO[ZEnv, Nothing, ExitCode] = 
    mainApp.exitCode
}
```

Sometimes an effect needs more than one environmental service, it doesn't matter, in these cases, we compose all dependencies by `++` operator:

```scala mdoc:silent:nest
import zio.console._
import zio.random._

val effect: ZIO[Console with Random, Nothing, Unit] = for {
  r <- nextInt
  _ <- putStrLn(s"random number: $r")
} yield ()

val mainApp: ZIO[Any, Nothing, Unit] = effect.provideLayer(Console.live ++ Random.live)
```

We don't need to provide live layers for built-in services (don't worry, we will discuss layers later in this page). ZIO has a `ZEnv` type alias for the composition of all ZIO built-in services (Clock, Console, System, Random, and Blocking). So we can run the above `effect` as follows:

```scala mdoc:silent:nest
import zio.console._
import zio.random._
import zio.{ExitCode, ZEnv, ZIO}

object MainApp extends zio.App {
  val effect: ZIO[Console with Random, Nothing, Unit] = for {
    r <- nextInt
    _ <- putStrLn(s"random number: $r")
  } yield ()

  override def run(args: List[String]): ZIO[ZEnv, Nothing, ExitCode] =
    effect.exitCode
}
```

ZIO environment facility enables us to:

1. **Code to Interface** — like object-oriented paradigm, in ZIO we encouraged to code to interfaces and defer the implementation. It is the best practice, but ZIO does not enforce us to do that.

2. **Write a Testable Code** — By coding to an interface, whenever we want to test our effects, we can easily mock any external services, by providing a _test_ version of those instead of the `live` version.

## Defining Services in OOP

1. **Defining a Service** — In object-oriented programming, we define services with traits. A service is a bundle of related functionality which are defined in a trait:

```scala mdoc:silent:nest
trait FooService {

}
```

2. **Implementation** — We implement these services by using classes:

```scala mdoc:silent:nest
class FooServiceImpl extends FooService {
    
}
```

3. **Defining Dependencies** — If the creation of a service depends on other services, we can define these dependencies by using constructors:

```scala mdoc:silent:nest
trait ServiceA {

}

trait ServiceB {

}

class FooServiceImpl(a: ServiceA, b: ServiceB) {

}
```

In object-oriented programming, the best practice is to _program to an interface, not an implementation_. So in the previous example, `ServiceA` and `ServiceB` are interfaces, not concrete classes. 

4. **Injecting Dependencies** — Now, the client of `FooServiceImpl` service can provide its own implementation of `ServiceA` and `ServiceB`, and inject them to the `FooServiceImpl` constructor:

```scala mdoc:silent:nest
class ServiceAImpl extends ServiceA
class ServiceBImpl extends ServiceB
val fooService = new FooServiceImpl(new ServiceAImpl, new ServiceBImpl)
```

Sometimes, as the number of dependent services grows and the dependency graph of our application becomes complicated, we need an automatic way of wiring and providing dependencies into the services of our application. In these situations, we might use a dependency injection framework to do all its magic machinery for us.
